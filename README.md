Group snoop allows you to record data points on roblox groups to track changes. 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts --group groupID --timeout seconds --minRole (1-255)
```

# Min Role Info
Min Role is the minimum role to track. It is recommended in larger groups to do at least two depending on how rankings work
however it is still possible to track a large amount of members however roblox's api will take a while
